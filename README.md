# TurboMMC Explorer

TurboMMC explorer - this is a BBC Basic program which allows the selection of discs in a TurboMMC (and possibly others) system on a BBC Model B. Once selected ypu can then view the file list for the disc. In essence this program is designed to remove the need to use *DCAT, *DIN and *CAT so often to see what it on a disc.

The main reason for writing this is to give me something to work with to get to grips with assembly language. I will be re-writing the slow parts of this program in assembly as and when time permits. 

I don't have any other hardware (e.g. other MMC system or a BBC Master etc.) to test with but I suspect that it won't work on a Master due to the fact that it gets data directly from system memory to build the disc lists etc.

This also won't run across the Tube due to the direct memory access.
